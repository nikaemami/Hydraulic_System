# Hydraulic_System
State-space realization and simulation of a non-linear hydraulic system in MATLAB and Simulink.


In this project, simulation of a non-linear hydraulic system by designing a controller for it was developed. The system is considered to be single input/single output. The input is the flow of water, and the output is the temprature of the water inside the tank.
The analysis of the root locus and bode diagrams, and the design of a lead-lag compensator are developed in the attached files.
The state equations are also developed in Simulink blocks.
By analyzing the function of the controller with different parameters, the system was finalized.
